# Automated Fitness Exercise Programming with Genetic Algorithms

## Description:
A genetic algorithm created using Python and vectorized operations with NumPy which automates the process of creating unique and individualized exercise plans for each user.

The algorithm uses a web scraped set of exercises that have been edited and appropriately labeled to match rules given from physical trainers which dictate what a good exercise plan should contain. (Dataset not included in this repository)
